## What is CornerStore?

CornerStore is an open source NFT marketplace built by Rarible DAO using the Rarible Protocol. Prosopo has forked and
modified the marketplace to work
with [OpenBrush's PSP34 contracts](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/examples/psp34). The
PSP34 contracts have also been modified so that they
are [protected](https://github.com/prosopo-io/demo-nft-marketplace/blob/57fe32a36d2988d3076835fc3ebe3a4dad60efa3/contracts/lib.rs#L209)
by Prosopo's human verification system.

### How it works

The NFT marketplace is composed of two parts - the website and the smart contract backend. A user is requested to
connect their web3 account when they enter the marketplace. Once an account has been selected they can begin the
purchase process. Upon clicking buy, the website frontend checks if the user's account has previously completed captcha
challenges by calling the [prosopo protocol contract](https://github.com/prosopo-io/protocol/). If the user has answered
the majority of previous captcha challenges correctly within a certain timeframe, they will be allowed to purchase an
NFT. Otherwise, they will be shown a captcha challenge.

There are additional checks in the NFT marketplace smart contract that prevent the user from calling the NFT marketplace
contract directly, bypassing the frontend checks.
